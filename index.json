They are mentally intact, retaining only the control of vertical eye movements and blinking. In this work, we present a one-dimensional typing interface controlled exclusively by vertical eye movements and dwell-time for them to communicate at will. Hidden Markov Model and Bigram Models are used as auto-completion on both word and sentence level. We conducted two preliminary user studies on non-disabled users. The typing interface achieved 3.75 WPM without prediction and 11.36 WPM with prediction.","tags":["Locked-in Syndrome","eye gaze typing","one-dimensional text entry"],"title":"Quantifying Touch: New Metrics for Characterizing What Happens During a Touch","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junhan Kong","Mingyuan Zhong","James Fogarty","Jacob O.

But touches are not atomic—they unfold over time and space, especially for users with limited fine motor function, for whom it can be difficult to perform quick, accurate touches. To gain insight into what happens during a touch, we offer 15 target-agnostic touch metrics, most of which have not been mathematically formalized in the literature. They are touch direction, variability, drift, duration, extent, absolute/signed area change, area variability, area deviation, area extent, absolute/signed angle change, angle variability, angle deviation, and angle extent. These metrics regard a touch as a time series of ovals instead of a mere (x, y) coordinate. We provide mathematical definitions and visual depictions of our metrics, and consider policies for calculating our metrics when multiple fingers perform coincident touches. To exercise our metrics, we collected touch data from 27 participants, 15 of whom reported having limited fine motor function. Our results show that our metrics effectively characterize touch behaviors including fine-motor challenges. Our metrics can be useful for both understanding users and for evaluating touch-based systems to inform their design.","tags":["touch input","touch screens","touch metrics","human performance","limited fine motor function"],"title":"Quantifying Touch: New Metrics for Characterizing What Happens During a Touch","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raymond Fok","Mingyuan Zhong","Anne Spencer Ross","James Fogarty","Jacob O.

We then examine longitudinal data in individual apps, presenting illustrative examples of accessibility impacts of systematic improvements, incomplete improvements, interface redesigns, and accessibility regressions.

But animated GIFs often lack adequate alternative text descriptions, and it is challenging to generate such descriptions automatically, resulting in inaccessible GIFs for blind or low-vision (BLV) users. To improve the accessibility of animated GIFs for BLV users, we provide a system called Ga11y (pronounced “galley”), for creating GIF annotations. Ga11y combines the power of machine intelligence and crowdsourcing and has three components: an Android client for submitting annotation requests, a backend server and database, and a web interface where volunteers can respond to annotation requests. We evaluated three human annotation interfaces and employ the one that yielded the best annotation quality. We also conducted a multi-stage evaluation with 12 BLV participants from the United States and China, receiving positive feedback.","tags":["images","crowdsourcing","accessibility","human annotation","text description","low vision","GIF","blind"],"title":"Ga11y: An Automated GIF Annotation System for Visually Impaired Users","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junhan Kong","Mingyuan Zhong","James Fogarty","Jacob O.

HelpViz transforms text instructions to graphical tutorials in batch, by extracting a sequence of actions from each text instruction through an instruction parsing model, and executing the extracted actions on a simulation infrastructure that manages an array of Android emulators. The automatic execution of each instruction produces a set of graphical and structural assets, including images, videos, and metadata such as clicked elements for each step. HelpViz then synthesizes a tutorial by combining parsed text instructions with the generated assets, and contextualizes the tutorial to user interaction by tracking the user's progress and highlighting the next step. Our experiments with HelpViz indicate that our pipeline improved tutorial execution robustness and that participants preferred tutorials generated by HelpViz over text-based instructions.

We enhanced a genetic algorithm to accommodate crowd worker responses from pairwise comparison of UI designs, which is crucial for obtaining reliable feedback.
