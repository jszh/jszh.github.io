abstract = { Wake-up-free techniques (e.g., Raise-to-Speak) are important for improving the voice input experience. We present ProxiMic, a close-to-mic (within 5 cm) speech sensing technique using only one microphone. With ProxiMic, a user keeps a microphone-embedded device close to the mouth and speaks directly to the device without wake-up phrases or button presses. To detect close-to-mic speech, we use the feature from pop noise observed when a user speaks and blows air onto the microphone. Sound input is first passed through a low-pass adaptive threshold filter, then analyzed by a CNN which detects subtle close-to-mic features (mainly pop noise). Our two-stage algorithm can achieve 94.1% activation recall, 12.3 False Accepts per Week per User (FAWU) with 68&nbsp;KB memory size, which can run at 352&nbsp;fps on the smartphone. The user study shows that ProxiMic is efficient, user-friendly, and practical.},
